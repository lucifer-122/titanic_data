# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to gain insights into the passenger information and survival rates. The dataset contains information about the passengers onboard the Titanic, including their demographics and survival status.

## Introduction

The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset used for data analysis and machine learning tasks. It provides information about the passengers who were aboard the Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage. In this project, we perform various operations on the dataset to extract meaningful insights.

## Operations Performed

1. Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file using the pandas library.

2. Data Exploration: We explore the dataset to understand its structure, columns, and data types.

3. Data Cleaning: We handle missing values by either removing or imputing them to ensure the dataset is suitable for analysis.

4. Data Visualization: We create visualizations to understand the distribution of passengers' attributes and explore relationships between variables.

5. Passenger Survival Analysis: We analyze the survival rates based on different factors such as gender, age, passenger class, etc.

6. Fare Analysis: We count the number of passengers who paid a fare greater than $100.

7. Embarkation Port Analysis: We count the number of passengers by embarkation port and plot the results.
